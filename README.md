This project is a part of HSP 620 Research Project in Economics II : Economics Department at IIT Delhi under course instructor [Prof. Debasis Mondal](https://hss.iitd.ac.in/faculty/debasis-mondal)

This research project explores the relative importance of sectoral productivity and labor market distortion for the structural change in India between 1960 and 2018. The project uses the IPUMS micro-series data-set to compute human capital by sector and infer labor market distortion as sectoral wage gaps per human capital unit. These sectoral distortions are incorporated into a structural change model and calibrated model to reproduce India’s time paths of sectoral labor shares. Counterfactuals are carried out to study the impact of the agricultural sector’s TFP(Total Factor productivity) growth and labor market distortion on agricultural labor share. The paper tries to find a reason for the delayed transformation in India.
